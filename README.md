Our project is to build a dating app with the swiping function.

## Technologies Used:

## Features:
* Users can register a new account, edit the profile information and delete their profile once found the true love. 
* Not only the users can upload one profile picture, they can upload multiple pictures in their gallery and all the images will be shown in carousel.
* Swiping function based on users' preferences.
* Once swiped left (not interested), the un-interested profiles will never be shown again.
* With the chatting function, once swiped right and it's a matched, users can start chatting with the matched profiles.
* Users can unmatch anytime they want and all the chat history will be deleted. 
* The app is styled with responsive design. 


## General Approach
We started by discussing what functions we want it to be in our app. Then discuss how to structure our model, routes and components.
